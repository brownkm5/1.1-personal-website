      Lebowski ipsum walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish. You're fucking Polish Catholic. Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit praesent ac magna justo pellentesque ac. Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate. Lectus quis elit blandit fringilla a ut turpis praesent felis ligula, malesuada. You know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around.

      One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you. That wasn't her toe. Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. Mind if I smoke a jay? Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred. Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it? Shomer shabbos.
